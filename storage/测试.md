13. An EC2 instance requires temporary storage of data that changes frequently and is only needed during the instance lifecycle. Which storage option is best suited for this purpose?
    + EC2 instance Store
14. A company wants to analyze their S3 object access patterns to determine when to transition objects to less expensive storage classes. Which tool can they use to obtain these insights?
    + S3 Analytics - Storage Class Analysis helps analyze S3 object access patterns to determine when to transition objects to less expensive storage classes.
15. A company requires a shared file system that can be simultaneously accessed by multiple Amazon EC2 instances. Which AWS service should they use?
    + EFS
16. An organization is looking for a way to save on storage costs for objects with unknown or changing access patterns. Which S3 storage class automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns?
    + S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns, saving costs for objects with unknown or changing access patterns.
17. A system administrator needs to grant read and write permissions to a single user on specific S3 objects. Which access control method allows this level of fine-grained permissions?
    + S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) can grant read and write permissions to a single user on specific S3 objects, allowing for fine-grained access control.
18. A company wants to automatically transition their old log files to a cheaper storage class after 30 days and then delete them after one year. Which S3 feature can automate this process?
    + S3 Lifecycle Policies can automate the transition of objects to a cheaper storage class after a certain period and define rules for automatic deletion after a specified time.
19. A database administrator is deploying a high-performance OLTP database system on AWS. Which Amazon EBS volume type should they choose to ensure consistent I/O performance and low latency?
    + Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) is an enhanced version that provides consistent I/O performance and low latency, suitable for high-performance OLTP database systems.
20. A data analyst needs to store large datasets that are infrequently accessed but require millisecond access when retrieved. Which S3 storage class is the most cost-effective choice?
    + 3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is designed for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. It offers a lower storage price point compared to S3 Standard.
21. A multinational company requires their S3 data to be replicated across regions for lower-latency access and compliance with data sovereignty requirements. Which S3 feature should they implement?
    + S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) replicates data across regions for lower-latency access and compliance with data sovereignty requirements.
22. A media company needs a high-performance file system for their compute-intensive workloads, such as high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and media data processing workflows. Which AWS service should they use?
